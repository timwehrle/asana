```

```

## Homebrew Installation

brew tap timwehrle/asana

## Having troubles with keyrings on WSL2?

If you're running into issues with keyring access on WSL2, there's a simple workaround!
You can find a detailed explanation here: [https://github.com/XeroAPI/xoauth/issues/25#issuecomment-2364599936](https://github.com/XeroAPI/xoauth/issues/25#issuecomment-2364599936)

To make development smoother, we've also provided a setup script.
It installs the necessary packages and configures the GNOME keyring automatically. You probably have to do this every time you start your WSL2 environment. 
```shell
chmod +x scripts/setup-wsl-keyring.sh
./scripts/setup-wsl-keyring.sh
```
After running the script, keyring functionality should be available in your WSL2 environment.

# Getting started

## Authentication

1. Get your Personal Access Token from Asana (Settings > Apps > Developer Apps)
2. Run the login command:
   ```shell
   asana auth login

3. Follow the prompts to paste your token and select your default workspace.

To check the current status of your authentication and the Asana API:
```shell
asana auth status
```
